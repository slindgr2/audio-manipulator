# audio-manipulator
Project to isolate background noise, and clean up sound quality.
We will be taking an audio file, and separating the frequencies. Next we will write code to take two roads, one which will amplify the background noise and cancel out the main sound, the other will try to improve the audio quality by predicting patterns in the sound waves.
